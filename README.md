This repository includes various sorting algorithms and algorithms that use binary search trees. They are all written in PHP.

## Sorting algorithms

### $\mathcal O(n^2)$ algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Insert sort
- Select sort
- Quick sort (worse case), but averages $\mathcal O(n \log(n))$

### $\mathcal O(n \log(n))$ algorithms
- heap sort
- merge sort

## Binary search tree
Contains the following functions
- create empty tree
- insert
- find
- delete
- is empty
- print in order
- max
- min
- get root
